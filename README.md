## Load Order:
* Core
* HugsLib
* JecsTools
* Humanoid Alien Races 2.0
* Story Framework 2.0
* [XND] Turret Extensions
* Other Mods
* Rimhammer 40k

Core is always first, it's the base game, frameworks (the four requirements) go right after Core, order typically shouldn't matter but that's for you to figure out by checking their descriptions and comments. Then functionality mods come after that, additional content mods, then factions/races/combinations of everything after that and finally any patches for the previous mods. Of course requirements always go before a mod that needs them, and patches/addons come after the mod(s) they affect. This is mostly just basic common sense.

## Collaboration:
If you think I should collab with another 40k mod, I either already am, I don't like the way it was done visually and/or mechanically or they refuse to allow use of their assets in another mod. 
So don't suggest any, I likely already know about them, and after a previous contributor pulled out and caused a couple of days work refilling the gaps I'm not interested in collaboration unless it's strictly made specifically for this mod.

## Translations:
No translations will be included till the mod is complete, if you want to make a patch that adds translations as a separate mod for now then feel free but with content being added and changed on a near daily basis at the moment I am not willing nor capable of keeping up with translations when I myself only speak English.

## Permissions:
Permission must be requested for any addons, alternative versions, or any other use of this mods assets, the only permission you have is for entirely personal use, NOT for redistribution. Permission will NEVER be granted for anything that would result in profiting off of our work or Games Workshops IP.
